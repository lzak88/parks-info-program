# parks-info-program
This project uses Python and leverages information from the National Park Service (NPS), the National Weather Service, and other data sets to create an application that provides comprehensive information regarding national parks. Upon user selection of a national park, the application prompts the user with a menu of options to display information including park description, current weather, recommended activities, and more. The app integrates static historical data in csv format with real-time updates via web scraping and APIs, in order to provide timely and relevant information to the end user. The app also provides visualizations of map location and historical visualization trends.  This program uses the following Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Geopandas, Json, Beautiful Soup, and Matplotlib.<br>
